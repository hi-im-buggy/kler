# Kler
Kler is a visual brainfuck interpreter written in C.

## Features

**TODO:**
- [X] visualize program counter and tape counter
- [X] fix loop handling
- [ ] exec multiple lines at once
- [ ] interactive mode should handle incomplete loops gracefully (prompt for more input till loop is closed properly)
